The way he cleaned the bowl was thorough
And then he came up to ask for more

In the morning Cinderella would fetch water,
At night she was the dazzling queen of the gala

Everytime the sun rises to shine
I am reminded of you, beautiful love of mine

My brother never trusted santa claus
So his name always fostered banter wars
